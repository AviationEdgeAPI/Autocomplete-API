# Autocomplete-API
Aviation Edge [Autocomplete API](https://aviation-edge.com/airport-autocomplete/) returns relevant airports and cities in the database based on the letters submitted. This allows users to pick the airport or city of their choice off the list after typing in the letters when the API is implemented. The airports the API returns include airports that have the submitted letters anywhere in them. For example, when the letters "ist" requested, the API returns both "**Ist**anbul Airport" and "Br**ist**ol Airport" (among other items).

The API is particularly useful for travel agency and flight booking websites, tools or apps to display the relevant airport and cities as a list for the user to choose from.

### Documentation
You may find input parameters, output examples with explanations for each item, filter list, and more in the [documentation](https://aviation-edge.com/developers/).

### Example Fields of Use
